# TODOs

 - Find a way to move a "BLock" twice before the next "Block" is tried (mainly in "BFS"). Either "Move" gets a "Direction... direction" (check how reverse works), or accept "Move... moves" as arguments.
 - Change the way "Blocks" are created, so that the "name" and "color" can be set manually.
 - Change the Project so that the "Solver" is separate from the Game itself, so that "RushHour", "So huepft der Hase" and others can be programmed and solved with the same engine.
 - Add Threads (ThreadPool) to "BFS".
 - Fix the Tests (TODo#2 might be neccessary for this).
 - Go over all "TODOs" in the src.
 - Interfaces? (Search, ...).
